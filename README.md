# nrf-radio - a high-level interface for the on-board radio of the nRF5xxx SoCs

Crate that manifested from https://github.com/nrf-rs/microbit/issues/172.
Huge thanks to the people that helped me to bring this to life with their helpful
comments and guidance.

One day, I hope to merge this into the mainstream nrf-hal crates, but for now, this crate
will do. Hope you enjoy using it.
