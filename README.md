# nrf-radio - a high-level interface for the on-board radio of the nRF5xxx SoCs

**THIS CRATE CURRENTLY ONLY SUPPORTS nRF51xxx SoCs. Sorry! This is the top priority for
me right after implementing the actual data sending mechanism.**

This crate is very much a work in progress. You probably shouldn't use it yet, as you
can't even send data between devices as of right now. I am working on it and will
implement this in the very near future, so please, be patient for now! ❤️

Crate that manifested from https://github.com/nrf-rs/microbit/issues/172.
Huge thanks to the people that helped me to bring this to life with their helpful
comments and guidance.

One day, I hope to merge this into the mainstream nrf-hal crates, but for now, this crate
will do. Hope you enjoy using it.
